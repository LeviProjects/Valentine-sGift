          Happy Valentine's mi amor precioso!!! I cannot express how lucky I am to have you and how glad I am that I get to spend another Valentine's Day with you. I'm so so proud of you, you have no idea. You are such a beautiful person inside and outside. You have such a beautiful soul, heart, mind, body and face. I love all the aspects of each of these things, I love the way that you've tried your best to stay as kind as you can be despite everything you've gone through. It is something that I genuinely admire about you. I also admire and adore how intelligent you are. There are so many things that you understand or know that I know I could never be able to. I love your voice as well, it's like music to my ears that makes me feel the comfort of home. I don't think I talk about this much either, because I get nervous to. But, I love your face and body so much too Levs. I love the way you scrunch your face sometimes, or the way you stick your tongue out sometimes. Something really cute is the little dimple you get sometimes on your upper lip, and the shape of your nose. Every time I see your face the first thing I notice are your eyes. I get so trapped in them that I stare at them dumbfounded as to how someone can have such kind and soulful eyes that I can't tell the difference between them and the warmth and depth of a sunset. Your body is so perfect too, obviously I haven't seen it in a while, but what I can say from what I remember is that I love all of it. Every pimple or stretch mark or scar or mark, I love all of them. All of the things you've disliked about your body I've never understood because to me it has always been perfect. Every time you send me a full fit/body photo I fold more than a lawn chair of how stunned I am at how amazing you look. Combine that with your killer sense of style and it's such a deadly combo.</p>

          I know you're atheist, and I've never believed much in religion, but you and your body being more beautifully hand-sculpted by god than a statue carved from the finest marble is proof enough for me. You're the reason I've started believing in the invisible string theory, and even if I'm convinced we've been meant to be in each other's lives, I still consider myself the luckiest person to live not just for getting to be with you, but for simply knowing you.
